Day 1: Establishing Backend and Frontend Processes
Challenges: Encountered issues with CORS while trying to enable communication between the frontend and backend. Realized the importance of properly configuring it to allow seamless interaction.

Wrap-Up: The project was a success, although I implemented only two of the CRUD operations. The primary goal was to gain a foundational understanding of how the backend interacts with the frontend, which I achieved effectively.
